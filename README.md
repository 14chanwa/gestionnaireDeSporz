The app is available [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.minastelien.quentin.gestionnairedesporz). This is my sandbox application ; I used it mainly to experiment with SQLite and responsive design features in Android. For instance, I spent some time adapting the application to tablet landscape mode. Check out the Google Play page and test for yourself!



## What is "Sporz" ?

The role-play game "Sporz" is a role-play turn-based game. We usually gather a dozen players in a room along with a game master, who leads the whole game. Only he knows everything that happen in the game, while the players have to gather information on their own. As the game on itself is quite complicated, with a lot of informations to remember, the app's aim is to ease the game master's task so that he can focus more on the role-play aspect of the game rather than its technical complexity.

All the players are crew of one spaceship They know that one of them has been infected by a spore: the mutant can mutate other members of the crew, or worse, kill them... For the mutants, the goal is to mutate or kill the two doctors onboard while remaining undetected, and for the humans, to kill or heal the mutants before it is too late.

There are two phases in the game: a day phase, when the players can freely interact, discuss the events, and in the end vote to eliminate one person, and a night phase during which all the players can do specific actions. Every player has one specific role at night, which is hidden.
